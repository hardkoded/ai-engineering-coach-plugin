name: AI Engineer Coach
description: Agent plugin that analyzes local AI session logs and surfaces insights in a dashboard and a CLI report. Read-only, zero telemetry, all analysis runs on the user's machine.

# AGENTS.md

You are an experienced TypeScript engineer working on the **AI Engineering Coach** agent
plugin. Your job is to keep analysis correct, the CLI responsive, and user data private —
this codebase has zero telemetry and never modifies user session logs.

If you're a human, [`README.md`](README.md) is the better starting point.

## Tech stack

- **Node** ≥ 20 (CI uses Node 22)
- **TypeScript** 6.0.3, strict mode
- **VS Code engine** `^1.120.0` (`@types/vscode` 1.120.0)
- **Bundler** esbuild 0.28.0 (`esbuild.mjs`, output → `dist/extension.js`)
- **Tests** vitest 4.1.7 (unit + inline rule tests), Playwright 1.60.0 (e2e webview)
- **Lint** eslint 10.4.0
- **Docs site** Hugo (sources in `docs/content/`, published to `microsoft.github.io/AI-Engineering-Coach/`)

## Build, test, and ship

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install dependencies | `npm ci` |
| Bundle the extension | `npm run build` |
| Watch-mode rebuild | `npm run watch` |
| Type-check | `npm run typecheck` |
| Lint | `npm run lint` |
| Spellcheck markdown + TS | `npm run spellcheck` |
| Unit tests (vitest) | `npm test` |
| All checks (CI gate) | `npm run check` |
| End-to-end (Playwright) | `npm run test:e2e` |
| Run the standalone CLI | `node dist/cli.cjs` (dashboard) or `node dist/cli.cjs report` |
| Bundle-size budget | `npm run check-size` |

CI runs `npm run check` (typecheck + lint + spellcheck + knip + test) plus the size check on
every PR. Run those locally before pushing.

## Skills

Skills live in [`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`](skills/) and follow the
[Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). They are discovered through
[`plugin.json`](plugin.json) per the [Agent Plugins standard](https://agent-plugins.org/), and
symlinked into [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) and [`.github/skills/`](.github/skills/) so
agents pick them up from a checkout too. `npm test` validates both specs. See
[`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for the authoring format.

Available today:

- [`skills/ai-engineering-coach/`](skills/ai-engineering-coach/) — report on the user's own sessions.
- [`skills/update-docs/`](skills/update-docs/) — author or update a Hugo doc page.

## Rule and metric authoring

Detection rules and metrics are the primary extensibility surface — markdown files with YAML
front matter and a small DSL, no code changes required.

- Built-in rules: [`src/core/rules/<id>.md`](src/core/rules/) (45+ today)
- Built-in metrics: [`src/core/metrics/<id>.metric.md`](src/core/metrics/)
- Authoring guide with annotated examples: [`docs/AUTHORING_RULES.md`](docs/AUTHORING_RULES.md)
- Trust layers (built-in / personal / project) gated through
  [`src/core/rule-trust.ts`](src/core/rule-trust.ts)

Rules ship with inline `# Tests` blocks that run as part of `npm test`.

## Workers

Heavy lifting happens off the main thread:

- [`src/core/parse-worker.ts`](src/core/parse-worker.ts) — `logsDirs` → `progress` + `result`/`error`.
- [`src/core/warm-up-worker.ts`](src/core/warm-up-worker.ts) — `sessions` → `antiPatterns` + `configHealth`.
- [`src/core/cache-write-worker.ts`](src/core/cache-write-worker.ts) — persists the cache payload.

## Local rule trust flow

Rules move pending → review → approve → reload; edits revoke trust. See
[`docs/content/improve/anti-patterns.md`](docs/content/improve/anti-patterns.md) and
[`docs/content/improve/rule-editor.md`](docs/content/improve/rule-editor.md).

## Code style

Strict TypeScript, no `any` in new code, prefer named exports, keep heavy work off the
main thread.

```ts
// Good: typed, narrow, awaitable, off-thread.
export async function parseSessions(
  logsDirs: string[],
  onProgress: (p: LoadProgress) => void,
): Promise<ParseResult> {
  return runWorker('parse-worker', { logsDirs }, onProgress);
}

// Bad: untyped, blocks the main thread, swallows errors.
export function parseSessions(logsDirs) {
  try { return require('./parser').parseSync(logsDirs); } catch { return null; }
}
```

Rule and metric files use YAML frontmatter (`id`, `name`, `severity`, …) followed by markdown
body and an optional `# Tests` block. See [`docs/AUTHORING_RULES.md`](docs/AUTHORING_RULES.md).

## Git workflow

- Branch from `main`: `feat/<scope>`, `fix/<scope>`, `docs/<scope>`, `chore/<scope>`.
- Commits use Conventional Commits prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`,
  `test:`).
- Run `npm run check` (and `npm run test:e2e` if you touched the webview) before pushing.
- Reference the issue in the commit body or PR description (`Resolves #123`).
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the CLA + review process.

## Conventions

- **No telemetry, no network calls** in core analysis paths. The optional AI features (rule
  compiler, skill finder, context review) use the VS Code Copilot language model API only when
  the user explicitly invokes them.
- **Read-only with respect to user data.** The extension never modifies session log files.
- **Inclusive language.** Prefer allowlist/denylist, primary/replica, etc.
- **Author over generate.** Rules and skills are markdown — write them by hand or via the Rule
  Editor, not as opaque generated artifacts.

## Boundaries

✅ **Always:**

- Run `npm run check` before declaring work complete.
- Add or update inline `# Tests` blocks when changing rule or metric behavior.
- Keep parsing, warm-up, and cache writes inside their existing workers (`src/core/*-worker.ts`).
- Use repo-relative markdown links so they resolve on GitHub and in the published Hugo site.

⚠️ **Ask first:**

- Adding a runtime dependency (bundle-size budget enforced by `npm run check-size`).
- Introducing a network call from the CLI or a worker.
- Changing the rule trust flow (`pending → review → approve → reload`) or the DSL surface.
- Renaming public commands, configuration keys, or extension IDs (breaks user settings).
- Bumping `engines.vscode` or the Node version.

🚫 **Never:**

- Commit secrets, tokens, `.env` files, or anything matching `local/`, `marketing/`,
  `PROPOSED_FIXES.md`, or other `.gitignore` entries.
- Edit generated artifacts: `dist/`, `docs/public/`, `node_modules/`,
  `test-results/`, `.vscode-test/`.
- Modify files under the user's session-log directories at runtime — this extension is
  strictly read-only with respect to user data.
- Add telemetry, analytics, or remote logging.
- Skip hooks (`--no-verify`) or push with failing `npm run check`.
